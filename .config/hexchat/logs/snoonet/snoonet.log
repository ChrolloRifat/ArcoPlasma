Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 Welcome to the Snoonet Chat Network.
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 By connecting to Snoonet you indicate that you have read and
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 accept our policies as set out on https://snoonet.org/rules
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 Snoonet runs an open proxy scanner. If you continue connecting
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 to Snoonet, you agree to this scanning to protect our network
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 from scammers, spammers and the propagation of viruses.
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 Please visit our ruleset listed at https://snoonet.org/rules
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 Yes, this is so important we list it twice. Snoonet does not have
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 many network wide rules but the ones we do have we enforce
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 to the best of our ability. This may also include the use of
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 automated oper utilities and/or standalone network bots that may
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 join/part your channel, or the mass setting of channel modes across
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 all network channels to protect you and your users during times
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 of network turmoil.
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 Please join #help if you have questions about any of the above
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 information.
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 Network Administration may remove any problem user at any time
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 for the betterment of all users. This includes, but is not limited
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 to, trolling, attempting to receive or spread users personal
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 information (also known as Doxxing), vote brigading on any social
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 media websites, or any thing that network administration sees as
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 potentially harmful to the atmosphere of Snoonet.
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 Our network rules are located here: https://snoonet.org/rules
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 Ignorance is not an excuse - most of the network rules are common sense.
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 As of the last MOTD Update, Snoonet has never received a National
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 Security Letter, an order under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Nov 01 11:16:14 *	 Act, or any other classified request for user information.
